              <p>He left Prudential Federal and American Savings in 1988 to found Strategic Management and Consulting, which focused on property management and the resolution of distressed commercial properties including retail, office warehouse, medical office, hospitality and residential real estate. Mr. Stanger merged this company into Prowswood Companies in 1990, where he became Vice-President and Managing Director of the Equity Investment Division.
