          <h2>About ROC|Bridge Partners</h2>
          <p>ROC|Bridge Partners manages two value added funds incepted in 2009 and 2012 respectively.  The investment thesis of these funds is to invest, for the benefit of our LPs, in multifamily and selective commercial office assets acquired at a significant discount to replacement value in locations that exhibit superior macroeconomic characteristics relative to the U.S. as a whole.  We strive to add value to those assets through superior property management, including capital investment, leasing, operations, maintenance, and capital structure, to optimize prior to monetization at a profit.We believe that the U.S. real estate market, especially in the multifamily and commercial office sectors, offers some of the most compelling value and prospective returns in the world today.
