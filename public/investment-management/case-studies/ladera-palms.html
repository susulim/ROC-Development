              <h3>Oppurtunity</h3>
              <p>ROC|Bridge was presented with the opportunity to purchase a note collateralized by Ladera Palms, a multifamily property composed of 784 units in Fort Worth, TX.  The asset was built in 1984 and is located on 4500 Campus Drive, which is conveniently six miles south of the Fort Worth CBD (have map locator here).</p>
              <p>The previous owner had purchased the property in early 2006 for over $17 million and completed over $6 million toward rehabilitating and repositioning the property.  At the time of purchase, the property had a note outstanding of approximately $21.5 million.</p>
              <p>Despite the investments made by the previous owner, the management was unable to grow NOI significantly, and experienced negative cash flow due to the size of the debt. The previous owner had subsequently agreed to cooperate with the creditor to go through foreclosure.</p>
              <p>Through our extensive contacts at the FDIC and the lending bank, we learned of the pending disposition of the first mortgage note and were able to conduct proprietary negotiations to acquire the note and foreclose on an expeditious basis.</p>
              <p>This opportunity allowed us to purchase a note at a significant discount, foreclose and clean up title, add significant value through the strategies outlined above, stabilize, and then sell to a buyer interested in stabilized properties.</p>
              
              <h3>Execution</h3>
              <p>The ROC|Bridge principals moved quickly to purchase the note in April 2009, completed the foreclosure by July 2009 and took over management shortly thereafter.  The basis at acquisition was 45% of the face value of the note and well below the estimated replacement cost of the property.</p>
              <p>ROC|Bridge&#8217;s principals, completed the following physical and operational changes:</p>

              <ul class="summary_list">
                <li>Improved security by making sure all entry/exits worked properly and incorporating a security officer at the entry.</li>
                <li>Upgraded and brought the clubhouses back online, providing broader amenities and meeting spaces for our resident base.</li>
                <li>Established community outreach programs including ESL, Career, and Medical education classes.   Worked with Catholic Charities to place families into the community.</li>
                <li>Removed all delinquent tenants and established more stringent criteria for new tenants.</li>
                <li>Reduced controllable expenses, specifically utility service contracts, payroll, taxes, and insurance.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Results</h3>
              <p>Within the first 14 months of ownership the ROC|Bridge team achieved its 3-year cash net operation income (NOI)  target by doubling NOI from approximately $900,000 to $1,900,000.  The ROC|Bridge team accomplished this by reducing collection losses by over 80%, increasing physical occupancy from 87% to over 90%, and dramatically reducing operating expenses.</p>
              <p>The property was sold in January 2011 (21 months after purchase). The return multiple was 2.13x.</p>
