              <h3>Oppurtunity</h3>
              <p>ROC|Bridge was presented with the opportunity to purchase a multifamily property in Dallas, TX from a CMBS Special Servicer.  The asset was built in 1984 and is located on 9669 Forest Lane. (add map locator)  The previous owner allowed Indigo to fall into a state of disrepair which caused occupancy to fall significantly.  In May 2009, the property was turned over to a court appointed receiver.   At the time of purchase the occupancy had fallen to approximately 45%.  To reach stabilization the asset needed substantial renovation, marketing, and management improvements.</p>
              <p>The opportunity in this transaction was to acquire an excellent  asset, in an improving neighborhood, from a highly motivated lender at a significant discount, and with a competitive, interest only debt package included.  ROC|Bridge’s principals planned to implement its business plan designed to effectuate the strategies outlined above, and reach stabilization by the end of the third year of ownership.</p>
              
              <h3>Execution</h3>
              <p>ROC|Bridge’s principals were able to successfully purchase the asset in June 2010 at 39% of estimated replacement cost.  Since acquisition, ROC|Bridge has completed the following:</p>
              
              <ul class="summary_list">
                <li>Completed $4.5 million in capital improvements.  These improvements were all completed faster than expected and within the overall original budgets.</li>
                <li>Security upgrades, clubhouse renovations and repositioning designed to provide comprehensive amenity and community services programs including upgrading the fitness center, adding a soccer field, improving landscaping, providing community education classes, a business center, children’s play areas, unit upgrades, and needed deferred maintenance improvements.</li>
                <li>Implementing a utility reimbursement program which increased revenues substantially.</li>
                <li>Reducing operating expenses substantially by renegotiating utility contracts, cutting controllable expenses, and reducing collection losses.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Results</h3>
              <p>Thus far ROC|Bridge has increased occupancy from 45% to over 83%.  Stabilized occupancy is estimated to be 85%.  ROC|Bridge has nearly stabilized the property a year faster than originally forecasted.</p>
              <p>As a result of both increased rents and occupancy, and reduced operating expenses, annualized net operation income has increased from negative ($264,000) to over $2.25 million.</p>
              <p>This asset will be positioned for sale in the 4th quarter of 2012.</p>
